Lots of tweaks have been made to melee combat recently, mostly
in order to debuff it--running around with a machete was WAY too
easy.
One of the biggest changes is that cutting weapons may get stuck
in the flesh of your target--and possible pulled from your hand.
This slows both you and your target.  This effect is reduced by
your cutting skill and strength.
Bashing damage is less reliable, but still can slow your enemy
by making them stumble a bit.  It's also capped by low strength,
so if you plan on using bashing weapons--or occasionally bashing
with your rifle--strength is more important now.
Finally, there are "spears"--mostly the craftable spears and
similar items--which do very little damage unless you get a crit
but can massively slow your enemies.  There's also a related
skill, "stabbing weapons," which also boosts crit damage when
using combat knives, nail boards, or other stabbing action.
